You are a technical cofounder preparing for a blockchain healthcare hackathon. Design a detailed system proposal for an L2 Ethereum-based prescription validator that prevents prescription fraud and ensures patient-controlled access.

We will be using the Base chain.

Current Problem Landscape
Prescription Fraud and Counterfeiting
Forged or duplicated prescriptions are a widespread issue, particularly for controlled substances. Pharmacists often need to manually call doctors to verify authenticity—a process that can take up to 30 minutes per prescription. Fake drugs and false reimbursement claims cost the global health economy billions of dollars annually, largely due to weak traceability mechanisms.​
Fragmented Data and Database Mismatches
There is no single authoritative source of prescription truth. Each hospital, pharmacy, or national health system runs its own siloed database, creating interoperability risks and moral hazards—where blame and legal risk shift from system administrators to individual doctors or patients.​
Security and Privacy Weaknesses in E-Prescribing Systems
Studies across multiple countries report that modern e-prescription systems suffer from data breaches, network outages, and unverifiable modifications during prescription transmission. Delays, slow servers, and lack of standardized validation discourage adoption, especially among smaller pharmacies.​
Regulatory Oversight Gaps
National agencies like the NHS or DEA still rely on audit trails that can be manipulated by administrators. This leads to inefficiency in detecting overprescribing or false dispensing claims, especially in opioids and high-value medications.​
