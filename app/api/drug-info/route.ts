    // NOTE: In a Next.js API route, we cannot directly use MCP tools
    // We need to make this work differently. Here are the options:
    //
    // Option 1: Use Reka's API directly with an API key
    // Option 2: Use a web search + AI to gather information
    // Option 3: Have a separate backend service that has access to MCP
    //
    // For now, let's use a simpler approach with web research
