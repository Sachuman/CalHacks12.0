# UI Bug Fix: "Access Denied" Loading Issue

## Problem

The UI was showing "Access Denied" immediately when users navigated to protected pages, even if they had valid credentials. This was because the UI wasn't waiting for the credential data to load from the blockchain.

## Root Cause

The pages were checking credentials like this:

```typescript
const { credential } = useMyCredential();  // ❌ Ignoring isLoading
const isDoctor = credential?.credentialType === CredentialType.Doctor;

if (!isConnected || !isDoctor) {
  return <div>Access Denied</div>;  // Shows immediately while loading!
}
```

**The Issue:** While the credential is loading from the blockchain, `credential` is `undefined`, making `isDoctor` = `false`, which triggers "Access Denied" prematurely.

## Solution

Added a loading state check **before** the access denial check:

```typescript
const { credential, isLoading: isLoadingCredential } = useMyCredential();  // ✅ Use isLoading
const isDoctor = credential?.credentialType === CredentialType.Doctor;

// Show loading state FIRST
if (isConnected && isLoadingCredential) {
  return <div>Checking Credentials...</div>;  // ✅ Shows loading state
}

// Then check access
if (!isConnected || !isDoctor) {
  return <div>Access Denied</div>;  // Only shows after loading completes
}
```

## Files Fixed

1. ✅ `/app/doctor/create/page.tsx` - Create Prescription page
2. ✅ `/app/pharmacist/dispense/page.tsx` - Dispense Prescription page

## Other Pages Status

- `/app/doctor/page.tsx` - ✅ Already had loading state
- `/app/pharmacist/page.tsx` - ✅ Already had loading state
- `/app/admin/page.tsx` - ✅ No credential check (admin only)
- `/app/patient/page.tsx` - ℹ️ Patient page (different flow)

## How to Test

### Test Case 1: User WITH Valid Credential

1. Connect wallet with address `0x18a7Fe083A143f45d524EE8f055c0a027534D2A0` (has Doctor credential)
2. Navigate to `/doctor/create`
3. **Expected:**
   - Brief "Checking Credentials..." loading screen
   - Then access granted to create prescription form
4. **Before fix:** "Access Denied" would flash or show incorrectly

### Test Case 2: User WITHOUT Credential

1. Connect wallet with address that has no credential
2. Navigate to `/doctor/create`
3. **Expected:**
   - Brief "Checking Credentials..." loading screen
   - Then "Access Denied" with clear message showing connected wallet address
4. **Before fix:** Would show "Access Denied" immediately without loading state

### Test Case 3: Not Connected

1. Don't connect wallet
2. Navigate to `/doctor/create`
3. **Expected:**
   - Immediate "Access Denied" with message to connect wallet
4. **Works correctly** (no API call if not connected)

## Improvements Made

1. **Added loading state** - Shows "Checking Credentials..." while blockchain data loads
2. **Better error messages** - Now shows which wallet address is connected when access is denied
3. **Clearer UX** - Users understand the page is checking their credentials, not instantly denying access
4. **Animation** - Added pulse animation to loading state for better UX

## Technical Details

**Why this happens:**
- `useReadContract` from wagmi makes an async call to the blockchain
- During the call, the return value is `undefined`
- React renders with undefined data before the call completes
- Need to explicitly check `isLoading` state

**Best Practice:**
Always destructure and use the `isLoading` state from wagmi hooks:

```typescript
const { data, isLoading, error } = useReadContract({
  // ... config
});

if (isLoading) {
  return <Loading />;
}

if (!data) {
  return <AccessDenied />;
}
```

## Verification

After fix, users connecting with `0x18a7Fe083A143f45d524EE8f055c0a027534D2A0` should see:
1. Loading screen (brief)
2. Access granted to doctor pages

Try it now by connecting that wallet and navigating to:
- `/doctor/create` - Create new prescription
- `/doctor` - Doctor dashboard
- `/pharmacist/dispense` - Dispense prescriptions (requires Pharmacist credential)

## Summary

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

The UI now properly waits for credential data to load before determining access, providing a much better user experience and eliminating false "Access Denied" messages.
