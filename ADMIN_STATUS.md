## ✅ Successfully Completed

**Your Address:** `0xc3e5734af56c880d89ac7406c8fcf484dfdb0e2d`

### What Was Done

#### 1. MedicalCredentialSBT Ownership Transfer ✅
- **Contract:** `0x76120F9CA2D6FB5aAac8b22719b8347Ed90e7448`
- **Previous Owner:** `0x0E1366113BB38Cd76f792642d1a1168024c6970A`
- **New Owner:** `0xc3e5734af56c880d89ac7406c8fcf484dfdb0e2d` (YOU!)
- **Transaction:** `0x521ee3f8cf8a94f7e5bfc80d8ad45dd761537ff95228b4a4b98e50d4b99d99a1`
- **Status:** **COMPLETE** ✅

#### 2. PrescriptionRegistry Signer Addition ⏸️
- **Action Proposed:** Add your address as a signer
- **Action Nonce:** 1
- **Current Approvals:** 1/2
- **Status:** **PENDING** (requires 2nd approval - see issue below)

### What You Can Do Now

#### As MedicalCredentialSBT Owner:
✅ **Issue medical credentials** (Doctor/Pharmacist SBTs)
✅ **Revoke credentials** (suspend licenses)
✅ **Reactivate credentials**
✅ **Update credential expiry** (renew licenses)
✅ **View all credentials**

You can now use the admin dashboard at `/admin` to:
- Issue credentials to healthcare providers
- Manage existing credentials
- Verify medical professionals

### Known Issue: PrescriptionRegistry Multi-Sig

The PrescriptionRegistry contract has a configuration issue:
- Requires 2 signatures for governance actions
- All 3 current signers are the **same address** (`0x0E1366113BB38Cd76f792642d1a1168024c6970A`)
- This means only 1 approval can be obtained (same address can't approve twice)

#### Impact:
- Cannot execute `executeAddSigner` (needs 2 approvals, only have 1)
- PrescriptionRegistry governance actions remain restricted

#### Solutions:

**Option 1: Deploy New PrescriptionRegistry (Recommended)**
```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployContracts \
  --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify
```

Update the signers in the deploy script to use different addresses.

**Option 2: For Testing - Deploy with REQUIRED_SIGNATURES = 1**
Temporarily modify the contract constant and redeploy.

**Option 3: Work Around (Current State)**
- Use the MedicalCredentialSBT owner powers (this is what you have now!)
- For prescription operations, use the frontend as a doctor/pharmacist (not admin)

### Contract Addresses (Base Sepolia)

| Contract | Address | Your Role |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| MedicalCredentialSBT | `0x76120F9CA2D6FB5aAac8b22719b8347Ed90e7448` | **Owner** ✅ |
| PrescriptionRegistry | `0x4E25233EAaF9D75E282C76c49D88d5aE57BfA94a` | Pending Signer (1/2) |

### Next Steps

1. **Test your admin access:** Go to `/admin` and try issuing a test credential
2. **Decide on PrescriptionRegistry:** Choose one of the solutions above if you need multi-sig governance
3. **For production:** Deploy to Base mainnet with proper multi-sig setup (3 different signer addresses)

### Quick Test

To verify your admin access works:

```bash
# Check you're the owner
cast call 0x76120F9CA2D6FB5aAac8b22719b8347Ed90e7448 "owner()(address)" \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org

# Should return: 0xC3E5734AF56c880d89Ac7406C8FCf484DFdB0E2D
```

## Summary

✅ **You are whitelisted as admin for credential issuance!**

You now have full control over the MedicalCredentialSBT contract, which is the primary admin function (issuing credentials to doctors and pharmacists).

The PrescriptionRegistry multi-sig governance remains pending due to the configuration issue, but this doesn't affect your ability to manage credentials.
